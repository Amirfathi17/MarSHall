        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <section> Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena video game and the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of
          the Ancients (DotA) mod. Developed by Valve Corporation, the game was officially released on July 9, 2013 as a
          free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, concluding a beta testing phase that began in 2011. OS X and Linux
          versions of Dota 2 were released on July 18, 2013. In most regions, Dota 2 is exclusively available through
          Valve's content delivery platform, Steam.</section>

        <section>Each match of Dota 2 involves two teams, both containing five players and occupying a fortified
          stronghold at either end of the map. Victory is achieved by destroying the enemy's Ancient, which is
          invulnerable until certain objectives are achieved. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on
          leveling up, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory during each match.
        </section>

        <section>Development of Dota 2 began in 2009, with the hiring of DotA developer "IceFrog" to serve as the
          sequel's lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by video game critics, who lauded it for remaining faithful to its
          predecessor while also increasing the level of production quality, as well as for its engaging and rewarding
          gamheplay experience. However, Dota 2 was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community.
          The game has become the most played on Steam, with daily peaks of over 550,000 concurrent players.</section>
